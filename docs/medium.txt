I've dabbled a bit in blockchain before, starting with Ethereum, after a lot of sweat
and tears I was able to create an application that minted NFT tokens represented by chess
pieces. This was several years ago and I remember the process being mostly tears. Really it's
not all that bad, but the point I'm trying to make is that I have managed to find a new tool
which has allowed me to create smart contracts without the hassles that come with
blockchain development.

Wanting to really dive into development using Reach I joined the Universities Unchained Hackathon
with very little expectations. What I was treated with was a helpful team that guided me through
every error message and warning statement to help me complete Battleship by the end of the hackathon.

What I created I wouldn't consider all that complicated. If you remove blockchain from the equation it's simply
an app that allows 2 people to compete with each other over guessing where the opponent place their ships on a 9x9 grid.
The user that guesses the most amount of correct ship locations wins the game. I simplified it even further by making it
