# Battleship

Battleship written in Reach and Reach running on the Algorand Blockchain. This project has been created to compete with the Universities Unchained Hackathon.

#### Dev Blog

Following the Rock Paper Scissors tutorial I have moved code here that will be used to run the battleship game. First step is to setup the player objects. This is seperated into three peices. The common objects named player, the deployer object which has a selected wager and and attacher object which has a function that can accept the wager.
